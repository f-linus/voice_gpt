# Voice Assistant

This project is a simple voice assistant that uses WhisperAI to transcribe audio to text, GPT-4 to generate responses, and ElevenLabs text-to-speech to speak the response.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to clone this repository and install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following commands:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-assistant.git cd voice-assistant pip install -r requirements.txt

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the voice assistant by running the following command:

python voice_gpt.py

## Usage

To use the voice assistant, simply speak into your microphone while pressing the "insert" key. Then wait for a response. The voice assistant will transcribe your speech to text using WhisperAI, generate a response using GPT-4, and speak the response using ElevenLabs text-to-speech.
